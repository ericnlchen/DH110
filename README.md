# DH 110: User Experience and Design

### The Challenge: *Design a Mobile App to Connect Families*


### My Project: *Shared Family Journal*
I aim to create a mobile app that allows families to share stories and anecdotes with one another. The app will be specifically geared towards families that include children, parents, and grandparents. Younger family members can share anecdotes from their day, while older family members can relate stories from when they were young. This will enable family members to connect across generations, and stay informed about one anothers' lives, even if they live far apart or don't interact on a daily basis.
