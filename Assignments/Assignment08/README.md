# Shared Family Journal
## Eric Chen
### Introduction
The goal of this project is to design a mobile app to help families connect. Specifically, we were tasked with enhancing connection between at least 3 generations. In brainstorming solutions to this problem, I reflected on some of the ways that I like to connect with my family. One of the biggest methods that popped into my head was through stories--my brother and I always love hearing my grandpa tell stories about when he was younger. Inspired by the idea of sharing stories, I decided to create a shared family jounalling app. This app would be a flexible platform that allows family members of all ages to share stories of all kinds, whether it's a story from long ago or a simple anecdote from their daily life. Other familiy members can read these stories and comment on them. I envision this app helping all families, but especially those whose members live far apart from one another. In this case, short daily interactions in writing can really glue the family together and allow for consistent connection at long distance.
### Design Statement
As stated above, the main issue I am attempting to solve is being out of touch with family, due to living far away or interacting infrequently. I see this as especially relevant to the connection between young people and their grandparents. It can be hard to bridge the generational divide between these groups, since their cultures and ways of life may be quite different. Nevertheless, it can be fulfilling for young people to interact with their grandparents, because they can learn about their family history, gain new perspective on their lives, and form a meaningful connection with someone who cares for them. My app will help facilitate this meaningful connection.
### Competitor Analysis
The first step towards developing my app was to take a look at existing products through a critical lens. We do this in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the status quo, in order to learn from strengths and improve upon weaknesses in our new product. It is also important to review existing products in order to ensure that the new product adds something new rather than just copying something that already existed. For my competitor analysis, I focused on two family connection apps--a family organiational app called Family Wall, and a shared journal app called Waffle.  

I analyzed these apps in two different ways. First, I conducted a **heuristic analysis** in which I analyzed how effectively the 2 apps conformed to Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics. These heuristics include general guidelines for improving usability, like "consistency" and "recognition over recall".
