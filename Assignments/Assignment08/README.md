# Shared Family Journal
## Eric Chen
### Introduction
The goal of this project is to design a mobile app to help families connect. Specifically, we were tasked with enhancing connection between at least 3 generations. In brainstorming solutions to this problem, I reflected on some of the ways that I like to connect with my family. One of the biggest methods that popped into my head was through stories--my brother and I always love hearing my grandpa tell stories about when he was younger. Inspired by the idea of sharing stories, I decided to create a shared family jounalling app. This app would be a flexible platform that allows family members of all ages to share stories of all kinds, whether it's a story from long ago or a simple anecdote from their daily life. Other familiy members can read these stories and comment on them. I envision this app helping all families, but especially those whose members live far apart from one another. In this case, short daily interactions in writing can really glue the family together and allow for consistent connection at long distance.
### Design Statement
As stated above, the main issue I am attempting to solve is being out of touch with family, due to living far away or interacting infrequently. I see this as especially relevant to the connection between young people and their grandparents. It can be hard to bridge the generational divide between these groups, since their cultures and ways of life may be quite different. Nevertheless, it can be fulfilling for young people to interact with their grandparents, because they can learn about their family history, gain new perspective on their lives, and form a meaningful connection with someone who cares for them. My app will help facilitate this meaningful connection.
### Competitor Analysis
The first step towards developing my app was to take a look at existing products through a critical lens. We do this in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the status quo, and to learn from strengths and improve upon weaknesses in our new product. It is also important to review existing products to ensure that the new product adds something of value. For my competitor analysis, I focused on two family connection apps--a family organiational app called Family Wall, and a shared journal app called Waffle.  

I analyzed these apps in two different ways. First, I conducted a **heuristic analysis** in which I analyzed how effectively the 2 apps conformed to Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics. These heuristics include general guidelines for improving usability, like "consistency" and "recognition over recall". The goal of this analysis is to discover usability issues by applying a theoretical framework developed by experts.  

In contrast to this method, I also conducted **usability testing**. In usability testing, I asked a volunteer user to attempt accomplishing certain goals using the product while talking out loud about any pain points that they encountered. While the heuristic analysis may be a useful starting point for identifying issues, there is no replacement for testing the product with an actual user. Doing so helped me uncover a lot more specific issues and hidden flaws that I didn't notice during heuristic analysis.

### User Research
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete this portion of the project due to personal family issues.  

### UX Storytelling
Once I had a general idea of the existing products and their issues, it was time to narrow down the target user and more clearly define how and why a user would engage with my app. In order to accomplish this UX storytelling, I developed two personas--imaginary people who can gain something from my app. Specifically, I chose to make my personas a high schooler and her grandfather, since this matches my vision of connecting families across multiple generations. For each persona, I described the tasks/goals that they might try to accomplish on my app. The highschooler creates a journal and shares it with her grandfather, and the grandfather creates a new entry in the journal and posts it for his granddaughter to read.

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation  
Once the tasks had been decided upon through UX storytelling, the next step was to design the functionality and interface to accomodate those tasks. I began with a simple wireflow of my app which showed various screens connected by arrows to illustrate where a user navigates by tapping the on-screen elements. Then, I experimented with different design choices for the interface, including font, size, and shape of UI elements. I decided on a standard graphic design system that would be implemented across the app.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype
I drew a low-fidelity prototype by hand in order to get a sense for the flow of each of my tasks, and I asked a volunteer user to test out the prototype for me. In doing so, I discovered certain missing features including back/cancel buttons, and a way to see which family members a given journal is shared with.

### High-Fidelity Prototype
Finally, I took my low-fidelity prototype, digitized it, polished it, and made it adherent to the graphic design system that I decided on. I used Figma for this portion of the project. You can read more about my process at the link below.

### Evaluation and Revision History
Throughout my project, I constantly evaluated my design and adjusted it according to the feedback I received or the testing processes I engaged in.  

The first means of testing was the usability test that I conducted on the competitor app Waffle. I asked my brother to try to accomplish certain tasks in the app while talking out loud about his thought process. This initial evaluation showed me some clear flaws with their design, like the broken drafts feature and the general difficulty of use for elderly users. I incorportated these ideas into my app as I moved forward through the UCD process. Specifically, these findings influenced me to choose an elderly grandfather as one of my two personas, to ensure that I designed with elderly users in mind.

The second test I conducted was a mini usability test of my low-fidelity prototype. For this evaluation, I asked my friend Savannah to try to accomplish the tasks I had chosen. Since my wireflow was drawn by hand, I showed her a screen, asked her to tell me which button she would tap, and told her which new screen that this would take her to. This test showed me some missing functionality that I hadn't considered, like cancel buttons and labels that show who a journal is currently shared with.

After developing my graphic design system, I asked my friend Matt to help me with an impression test. I asked him to take a look at my journal homepage wireframe and tell me anything that came to mind about the design. He commented on the look and feel of the buttons, saying that it looked professional while also fun. He also gave me a very useful piece of feedback about the font--the handwritten and underlined font was almost illegible. I took this information into account and redesigned the entry titles to use the standard sans-serif font instead.

Also as part of my interface design, I conducted an accessibility test to ensure that the color scheme of my app was suitable for everyone.

Finally, once I had developed my high-fidelity prototype, I engaged in a cognitive walkthrough with some of my classmates. In this process, we each attempted to use one another's app and we gave feedback on how easy it was to accomplish the goal. One specific point that I found interesting was that we were asked to comment on how easy it was for us to recognize that progress had been made towards the goal upon taking an action. This was something I hadn't considered before.
