# **Assignment 5: Low-Fi Prototype**
Eric Chen | DH110 | Spring 2023

## **Project Description:**
In the previous assignment, I created two *personas*--fictional characters that represent target users of my shared family journal app. My personas were a high schooler and her grandfather, and I described how they created a shared journal together and wrote new entries to connect with one another. In this assignment, I will condense these user stories into a low-fidelity prototype of the shared family journal app I am designing. I will show the basic features of each screen that is involved in the completion of the following two tasks:  

1. Creating and Sharing a New Journal
2. Adding an Entry and Reading New Comments

## **Intial Wireframes:**

These were the intial screens that I designed for my app. After I started to create the wireflow, I realized that certain functionality was missing. For example, there were no back buttons to return home to the "Your Journals" page. Also, I didn't include an option to quit writing an entry and save it as a draft for later. These issues only came to my attention once I started to draw arrows between screens to illustrate the flow, and realized that I had limited the user's freedom. In the wireflow that follows, I added in these missing functionalities.

## **Testing:**
I tested my wireflow by asking my friend Savannah to try to accompish the two tasks by looking at a version of the wireflow without the arrows. She told me where she wanted to click and which screen she thought this would lead her to. I corrected her when necessary, and noted the issues and points of confusion. I specifically wanted to use a version of my wireframe without arrows in order to ensure that the user was able to deduce the right interactions to accomplish the goal without being prompted by visual cues.

## **Reflection:**
Initially I expected to create my wireframes on Figma. However, the process of sketching them out by hand instead was surprisingly useful, because it encouraged me to focus on the functionality rather than the look and feel of each screen.  

For the testing process, I thought it went relatively smoothly and I received a lot of useful feedback. For the most part, my user was able to navigate the tasks with ease, but there were a few small points where she had trouble or requested clarification.  

Here are the top points that I took away from the testing session:
- When the user first starts, the homescreen of the app should be more explicit in alerting the user that they have no journals yet.
- In the "New Journal" screen, the box that says "Description" should probably say something more explicit like "Describe the purpose of your journal." The reason for this is that my test user initially thought that this was the place to write an entire journal entry.
- On the main screen of a journal that displays all the entries, it should also show the user who it is shared with.
- The "New Comment" notification should be more clearly identifiable as a notification badge rather than a button.
- There should be a "Delete" button for an entry that you want to dispose of.

The main theme of the feedback I received was to make instructions to the user more explicit and to display more information. This reminds me of the heuristsic of "recognition over recall," and I think I can use this principal to improve the functionalities that I make available on my app.
