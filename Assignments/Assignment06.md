## **Screen Design (Layout Test):**
Next, I tested design variations for a single screen: the journal homepage which displays the user's entries.  

For my overall layout grid, I chose to use 5 rows, 1 for the heading, 1 for the "Create New Entry" button, and 3 to display the user's journal entries. The user would be able to see more entries by scrolling, but 3 would be visible without scrolling. I choose to use 3 columns. Even though most of my content is arranged vertically rather than horizontally, this helps with the placement of the home button and list of contributors at the top of the screen. I used a margin of 10px and a gutter of 10px for both columns and rows, because this gave sufficient space between elements. Here is a picture of this general layout:

</p>

As you can see, I grouped the entry title and content into a rounded rectangle. This aids with the user's ability to see this content as a single group (an application of Gestalt theory).

### **Typographic Variations:**
Option 1: Playful look with handwriting style font in main heading.
- Main heading: Shadows into Light, 48px
- Date: Roboto, 16px
- Entry heading: Shadows into Light, 16px
- Body text: Roboto, 14px, line-height 150%
- Button: Roboto bold, 20px
- Notification badge: Roboto bold, 12px

Option 2: Clean minimal look with only sans-serif fonts
- Main heading: Roboto, 48px
- Date: Roboto, 20px
- Body text: Roboto, 14px, line-height 150%
- Button: Roboto bold, 20px
- Notification badge: Roboto bold, 12px

Option 3: Professional/elegant look with only serif fonts
- Main heading: Playfair display, 48px
- Date: Playfair display, 20px
- Entry date: Playfair display bold, 20px
- Entry heading: Playfair display bold, 14px
- Body text: Playfair display, 14px, line-height 150%
- Button: Playfair display bold, 20px
- Notification badge: Playfair display bold, 12px

### **Color Schemes:**
I created a light mode and a dark mode. The dark mode is essentially the light mode with colors inverted. The only difference is that I manually adjusted the red color of the "New Comments" notification badge.

I ensured that both color schemes achieved an accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level rating using the Stark plugin in Figma.
