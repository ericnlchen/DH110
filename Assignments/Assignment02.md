# **Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing**
Eric Chen | DH110 | Spring 2023

## **Introduction:**
In this assignment, I conducted a pilot usability test for the Waffle app. Waffle is a shared journaling app that lets friends and family share stories and thoughts with one another. This app is particularly relevant to my project, because I hope to design a shared journaling app similar to Waffle but more optimized for family use across multiple generations. Waffle provides basic functionalities like sharing journals, creating entries with text and images, and saving drafts to come back to them later.  

A **usable** software is defined as one which enables users to accomplish certain goals in an effective, efficient, and satisfying manner. The purpose of a **usability test** is to determine a software interface's usability by directly observing a user as they attempt to accomplish certain goals. The test is usually conducted with a group of users in a dedicated lab or portable test setting. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement.  

For this assignment, I am conducting a **pilot** test, which means that its purpose is to test my script, questionnaire, and equipment before engaging in an actual test.  

Since this is a pilot test, I have one participant. My participant tested the current version of the Waffle app on their Apple iPhone while filling out survey results on their personal laptop, which was also connected to me on a Zoom call. The participant's laptop camera captured their face throughout the duration of the test. The iPhone screen recording tool captured the participant's interactions with their phone.

## **Methodology:**
Describe how the participants were recruited. Describe the individual sessions – length of time and what happened during those sessions. Explain what the participant was asked to do and what happened post test session. Describe any pre- or post-test questionnaires. Include the subjective and overall questionnaires in the attachments’ section.

## **Test Materials:**

## **Reflection:**
Write a short paragraph about:
- what you learned during the pilot test, 
- what went well and what went not so well 
- how you want to improve your UT in the future
