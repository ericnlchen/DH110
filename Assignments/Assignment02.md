# **Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing**
Eric Chen | DH110 | Spring 2023

## **Introduction:**
In this assignment, I conducted a pilot usability test for the Waffle app. Waffle is a shared journaling app that lets friends and family share stories and thoughts with one another. This app is particularly relevant to my project, because I hope to design a shared journaling app similar to Waffle but more optimized for family use across multiple generations. Waffle provides basic functionalities like sharing journals, creating entries with text and images, and saving drafts to come back to them later.  

A **usable** software is defined as one which enables users to accomplish certain goals in an effective, efficient, and satisfying manner. The purpose of a **usability test** is to determine a software interface's usability by directly observing a user as they attempt to accomplish certain goals. The test is usually conducted with a group of users in a dedicated lab or portable test setting. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement.  

For this assignment, I am conducting a **pilot** test, which means that its purpose is to test my script, questionnaire, and equipment before engaging in an actual test.  

Since this is a pilot test, I have one participant. My participant tested the current version of the Waffle app on their Apple iPhone while filling out survey results on their personal laptop, which was also connected to me on a Zoom call. The participant's laptop camera captured their face throughout the duration of the test. The iPhone screen recording tool captured the participant's interactions with their phone.

## **Methodology:**
The participant was recruited by directly asking them in-person, and they volunteered their time with no compensation. The session lasted for just over 30 minutes. During the session, I acted as the moderator. First, I explained the test session and asked the participant for their informed consent. Then, I asked some pre-test questions before the participant interacted with the Waffle app. Next, I asked the participant to complete 3 tasks and when they completed all 3, they filled out 7-point Likert scale questions aimed at evaluating:
- How easy the tasks were
- How long the tasks took
- How likely the user was to do those tasks
Finally, the participant was provided with more general statments about the website which they agreed or disagreed with on a 7-point Likert scale. The qualities measured included:
- Ease of use
- How easy it was to learn
- Simplicity/complexity
- Degree of integration between various functions
- Degree of confidence using the app
Please see the **Test Materials** section below for the full list of questions.

## **Reflection:**
Write a short paragraph about:
- what you learned during the pilot test, 
- what went well and what went not so well 
- how you want to improve your UT in the future
