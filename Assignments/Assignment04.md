# **Assignment 4: Persona + Scenario**
Eric Chen | DH110 | Spring 2023

## **Introduction -- UX Storytelling:**
In this assignment, I create two *personas*--fictional characters that represent target users of my shared family journal app. This is one aspect of *UX Storytelling*, in which designers attempt to deeply empathize with users. The idea is that digital experiences should be designed from the perspective of the user first and foremost. Having a single persona in mind helps the designer to imagine an actual person who might be affected by this app.  

## **Note:**
In the previous assignments, I found that existing shared journal tools lack the ease-of-use that might be needed for an elderly grandparent. This finding influenced the personas I developed in this assignment.

## **Scenarios:**
 TWO scenarios. Each scenario illustrates a different activity/task to accomplish one of the features you described. The features envision the functionality you are considering as a design solution.

### Scenario 1
Erica tells her grandpa about the shared journal. Creates the journal and shares it with him.

#### Why?
What is the need?  
It's a Sunday afternoon and Erica and her parents just finished their weekly phone call with Erica's grandpa John. During the phone call, they told John about Erica's recent skateboarding competition, her parents' new car, and the unseasonably hot weather in San Diego this week. Grandpa John told them about the new book he's reading and the soccer games he's been watching. It was a good call and it left Erica feeling cheerful. At the same time, a part of her wishes that they could have talked a little longer. She wishes she could have told her grandpa more about her friends at school and how she's been excited about her upcoming science project. She also wishes her grandpa could have told her one of his awesome stories from when he was younger, which never fail to bring her joy and make her laugh. At the same time, she knows that 

#### How?

You need to break down each interaction step, vividly describe what kind of information is provided, what kind of interface was provided (ex. Button labeled “post”), and what the persona perceived, understood, and took an action (ex. Press the button labed “post”). Then, what happens after the persona’s action (ex. System feedback) and how the persona evaluated the action taken (ex. happy to find it successful, or frustrated to find it unsuccessful).
