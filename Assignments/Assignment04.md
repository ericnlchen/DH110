# **Assignment 4: Persona + Scenario**
Eric Chen | DH110 | Spring 2023

## **Introduction -- UX Storytelling:**
In this assignment, I create two *personas*--fictional characters that represent target users of my shared family journal app. This is one aspect of *UX Storytelling*, in which designers attempt to deeply empathize with users. The idea is that digital experiences should be designed from the perspective of the user first and foremost. Having a single persona in mind helps the designer to imagine an actual person who might be affected by this app.  

## **Note:**
In the previous assignments, I found that existing shared journal tools lack the ease-of-use that might be needed for an elderly grandparent. This finding influenced the personas I developed in this assignment.

## **Personas:**
